This Burger World software was designed and developed by the 2001 Lakeland Computer Information Systems II Class.
The orginal "Burger Worlds" A.K.A. McDonalds were coded in the 1999-2000 school year with MS-DOS QuickBASIC.
Everything Burger World has become came from the imagination of the Computer Information Systems Students.
Burger World has taken only a few months to complete after TWO YEARS of planning and design.
Touch Screen Monitors for this project have been supplied by Performance Concepts.
Our artists rendition of Burger World was not actually used as the logo.
Of course there was no one harmed in the long development process of Burger World.
The night before the first competition members of the Burger World team were at school until 11:00pm.
During the first competition members of the Burger World team had to completely reinstall windows on a crashed computer before the judges arrived for their second judging.
While more complete than the first Burger World BETA this software still has many ideas waiting for implementation.
